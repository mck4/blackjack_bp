# Can you see this?
# I was thinking maybe it would be ideal to separate the bp, the main(start.py),
# and blackjack.py for the simulator, you know, like Dr. O'Hara did it. I don't think
# Python gives you too difficult of a time doing that.

# I'm not sure if we would need two bps for the two and three # card hand?
# I don't think so but I didn't make it yet for this reason.
# By the way if you want to make separate .py files for the classes, feel free.

#If you want it to show up on github, make sure you commit and push. I was just committing &
#it wasn't showing up but when I pushed, it showed up

# So, in order:
# 1) VCS>Commit...
# 2) VCS>Git>Push...


# For starting the thing
